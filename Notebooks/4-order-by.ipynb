    "So far, you've learned how to use several SQL clauses. For instance, you know how to use SELECT to pull specific columns from a table, along with WHERE to pull rows that meet specified criteria. You also know how to use aggregate functions like COUNT(), along with GROUP BY to treat multiple rows as a single group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll learn how to change the order of your results using the ORDER BY clause, and you'll explore a popular use case by applying ordering to dates. To illustrate what you'll learn in this tutorial, we'll work with a slightly modified version of our familiar pets table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ORDER BY\n",
    "ORDER BY is usually the last clause in your query, and it sorts the results returned by the rest of your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the rows are not ordered by the ID column. We can quickly remedy this with the query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/6o9LuTA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORDER BY clause also works for columns containing text, where the results show up in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/ooxuzw3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reverse the order using the DESC argument (short for 'descending'). The next query sorts the table by the Animal column, where the values that are last in alphabetic order are returned first.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/IElLJrR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dates\n",
    "Next, we'll talk about dates, because they come up very frequently in real-world databases. There are two ways that dates can be stored in BigQuery: as a DATE or as a DATETIME.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DATE format has the year first, then the month, and then the day. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```YYYY-[M]M-[D]D```\n",
    "- YYYY: Four-digit year\n",
    "- [M]M: One or two digit month\n",
    "- [D]D: One or two digit day\n",
    "So 2019-01-10 is interpreted as January 10, 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DATETIME format is like the date format ... but with time added at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXTRACT\n",
    "Often you'll want to look at part of a date, like the year or the day. You can do this with EXTRACT. We'll illustrate this with a slightly different table, called pets_with_date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query below returns two columns, where column Day contains the day corresponding to each entry the Date column from the pets_with_date table:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/PhoWBO0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is very smart about dates, and we can ask for information beyond just extracting part of the cell. For example, this query returns one column with just the week in the year (between 1 and 53) for each date in the Date column:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/A5hqGxY.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find all the functions you can use with dates in BigQuery in this documentation under \"Date and time functions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- EXTRACT the day of the week (as day_of_week in the query below) from the timestamp_of_crash column, and\n",
    "- GROUP BY the day of the week, before we COUNT the consecutive_number column to determine the number of accidents for each day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we sort the table with an ORDER BY clause, so the days with the most accidents are returned first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Query to find out the number of accidents for each day of the week\n",
    "query = \"\"\"\n",
    "        SELECT COUNT(consecutive_number) AS num_accidents, \n",
    "               EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM timestamp_of_crash) AS day_of_week\n",
    "        FROM `bigquery-public-data.nhtsa_traffic_fatalities.accident_2015`\n",
    "        GROUP BY day_of_week\n",
