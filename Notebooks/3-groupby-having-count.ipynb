You can reference the tutorial at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/group-by-having-count).**\n\n---\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### COUNT()\nCOUNT(), as you may have guessed from the name, returns a count of things. If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column.\n\nFor instance, if we SELECT the COUNT() of the ID column in the pets table, it will return 4, because there are 4 ID's in the table.\n\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT parent, COUNT(ID) \n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nCOUNT() is an example of an aggregate function, which takes many values and returns one. (Other examples of aggregate functions include SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().) As you'll notice in the picture above, aggregate functions introduce strange column names (like f0__). Later in this tutorial, you'll learn how to change the name to something more descriptive.\n\n### GROUP BY\nGROUP BY takes the name of one or more columns, and treats all rows with the same value in that column as a single group when you apply aggregate functions like COUNT().\n\nFor example, say we want to know how many of each type of animal we have in the pets table. We can use GROUP BY to group together rows that have the same value in the Animal column, while using COUNT() to find out how many ID's we have in each group.\n\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT parent, COUNT(1) AS NumPosts\n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n        GROUP BY parent\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nIt returns a table with three rows (one for each distinct animal). We can see that the pets table contains 1 rabbit, 1 dog, and 2 cats.\n\n### GROUP BY ... HAVING\nHAVING is used in combination with GROUP BY to ignore groups that don't meet certain criteria.\n\nSo this query, for example, will only include groups that have more than one ID in them.\n\n```\nquery = \"\"\"\n        SELECT parent, COUNT(1) AS NumPosts\n        FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n        GROUP BY parent\n        HAVING COUNT(1) > 10\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\nSince only one group meets the specified criterion, the query will return a table with only one row.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Aliasing and other improvements\nA couple hints to make your queries even better:\n\n- The column resulting from COUNT(id) was called f0__. That's not a very descriptive name. You can change the name by adding AS NumPosts after you specify the aggregation. This is called **aliasing**, and it will be covered in more detail in an upcoming lesson.\n- If you are ever unsure what to put inside the **COUNT()** function, you can do COUNT(1) to count the rows in each group. Most people find it especially readable, because we know it's not focusing on other columns. It also scans less data than if supplied column names (making it faster and using less of your data access quota).\n\nfrom:\n\n```\n# Query to select comments that received more than 10 replies\nquery_popular = \"\"\"\n                SELECT parent, COUNT(id)\n                FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n                GROUP BY parent\n                HAVING COUNT(id) > 10\n                \"\"\"\n```\n\nto:\n```\n# Improved version of earlier query, now with aliasing & improved readability\nquery_improved = \"\"\"\n                 SELECT parent, COUNT(1) AS NumPosts\n                 FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n                 GROUP BY parent\n                 HAVING COUNT(1) > 10\n                 \"\"\"\n```\n\n\n### Note on using GROUP BY\nNote that because it tells SQL how to apply aggregate functions (like COUNT()), it doesn't make sense to use GROUP BY without an aggregate function. Similarly, if you have any GROUP BY clause, then all variables must be passed to either a\n\n1. GROUP BY command, or\n2. an aggregation function.\nConsider the query below:\n```\nquery_good = \"\"\"\n             SELECT parent, COUNT(id)\n             FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n             GROUP BY parent\n             \"\"\"\n```\nNote that there are two variables: parent and id.\n\n- parent was passed to a GROUP BY command (in GROUP BY parent), and\n- id was passed to an aggregate function (in COUNT(id)).\nAnd this query won't work, because the author column isn't passed to an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause:\n```\nquery_bad = \"\"\"\n            SELECT author, parent, COUNT(id)\n            FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`\n            GROUP BY parent\n            \"\"\"\n```\nIf make this error, you'll get the error message SELECT list expression references column (column's name) which is neither grouped nor aggregated at.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nQueries with **GROUP BY** can be powerful.
